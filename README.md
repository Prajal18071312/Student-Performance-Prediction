# Student-Performance-Prediction
Predicting student final grades using Python, ML, and Streamlit
This project predicts students' final grades (G3) based on study time, previous grades, failures, and absences. 
It is built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
